  *summary:
    »we can save our pictures based on colors type to:
      ›bite-mapped: 
        jpg|jpeg(jay peg), png(pee in gee), gif(giff|jiff), webP(weppy).
      ›vectore-based: svg(scalable vectore graphics).
    
    
  *jpeg.org: (Joint Photographics Expert Group)
    •properly for soft smooth color transition images (gradient & blended colors)
    •jpeg based on 24-bit(Truecolor 8-bit × rgb), support millions of colors.
    •jpeg lossy content on every compression !!
    •progressive jpegs improve perfermence, UX.
      ›by defualt jpeg's load linear from top to bottom.
      ›we can make jpeg processing number of passes(low→original resolution) before loading completed.
      ›edited by gulp-imagemin or photoshop.
  
  
  *png: (Portable Network Graphics)
    •features:
      ›Lossless compression
      ›Multiple-level (alpha) or simple on/off (binary) transparency
      ›Interluce(progressive) display in multiple passes
      ›Embedded gamma (brightness) adjustment information
      ›Embedded text for attaching information about the image
    
    •png based on: (8|24|48-bit rgb-colors) & (16-bit grayscale)
      »png-8: 
        ›properly for huge flat colors areas, as icons|logos
        »indexed numbers on each pixel of pallete, refer to the 2^(1~8)=2~256 colores that positioned in color-table|map.
          ›palletes methods:
            •Exact: if original colors ≤ 2^8=256.
            •Adaptive: to most used colors.
            •Perceptual(phs): Adabtive to human eye sansitivity.
            •Selective(phs): Perceptual to areas of broad color.
            •Web Adaptive, Restrictive, or Web216: useless
            •Custom
            •System
            •Optimized Median Cut (Paint Shop Pro Photo only): like Adabtive, but reduces color-table.
            •Optimized Octree (Paint Shop Pro Photo only): like Exact, but optimized.
        ›transparency: binarry(on|off) or variable(multi-levels)
      »png-24(Truecolor):
        ›properly to images with multi-levels of transparency.
        ›png-24 based on 24-bit(8-bit*rgb)|32-bit(8-bit*rgba)
        ›alpha transparecy channel can have 2^8=256 level.
      »apng: (94%G) animated image better than gif
        ›support 24-bit(Truecolor)
        ›support transparency alpha channel

    •addition features:
      ›Embedded text: like copyright meta-information
      ›Gamma correction channel: adjust brightness-level (unsupported)
      ›Embedded color profile information: store the ICC color profile information of the system it was created on.
      ›Progressive display (interlacing): not necessary (sizs↑)


  *gif: (Graphic Interchange format) (useless)
    •properly for large flat areas & binarry transparency
    •indexed based on 8-bit like png-8
    •lossless comprition.
    •support benarry transparency(on/off)(no-multi-levels)
    •interlacing like jpeg progressive.
    •animated frames.


  *webp: (web picture) (91% + 3.4% g)
    •monster kill all jpeg, png ,gif features.
      ›can be lossy|lossless comprition (like jpeg, png), with 40-70% small size.
      ›alpha transparency channel like png-24's
      ›animation like git & apng.
      ›can store meta & color profile ICC like png's
